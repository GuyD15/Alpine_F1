                <h2>About us</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Guy Domino, the creator behind this Alpine F1 portfolio website. As a web developer with a heart that races for Formula 1, this site is a fusion of my two greatest passions. My mission is simple: to build immersive web experiences that resonate with audiences. Just as F1 teams like Alpine push the limits of automotive engineering, I strive to push the boundaries of digital craftsmanship.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This website serves as a testament to my capabilities in front-end development, user experience design, and content strategy. Each line of code and pixel of design is carefully curated to present information in an engaging and intuitive manner. I welcome opportunities to drive digital projects to success. Get in touch via guywdominodev@gmail.com for collaborations, consultations, or conversations over coffee about the latest F1 season.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Interested in working together or want to see more? Check out my https://github.com/GuyD15 or drop me a line. Let's steer your project to victory lane!</p>
