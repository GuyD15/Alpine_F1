                <p>Gasly has shown some consistency, finishing within the top 10 in several races, with a season's best 6th place finish, demonstrating his ability to compete in the midfield. Ocon, however, has had a more tumultuous season with multiple retirements (Ret) noted. Despite these setbacks, both drivers have managed to secure points for the team, contributing to Alpine's tally in the Constructors' Championship.
