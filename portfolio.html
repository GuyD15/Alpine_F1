                        Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a proud graduate from Ohio State University's College of Engineering, holding a Full-Stack Web Development Certificate. My journey into web development has been fueled by a passion for creating seamless user experiences and robust back-end solutions. Here's an overview of the technologies and languages that empower my projects:</p>

                    In the development of "Quick Maffs," an engaging math game aimed at combining fun with educational learning, a variety of modern web technologies and development practices were employed. The game logic, including the timed challenges and score calculations, was powered by Node.js, with Express handling the routing to ensure a seamless user experience. User interactions and game notifications were dynamically managed using Alpine.js, enhancing real-time responsiveness.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>User account data was securely managed with Sequelize as the ORM for database operations and bcrypt for password hashing, ensuring safe user authentication. Handlebars templating engine rendered the views, providing a flexible UI structure. The application was deployed on Heroku, leveraging its cloud platform for accessibility and reliability. Through efficient multitasking and stringent deadline management, the project met all its critical milestones, resulting in a robust and interactive educational game.</p>

                        In the Space Explorer project, I spearheaded the integration of various NASA APIs to craft an app that brings the wonders of space exploration to users. The app highlights decades of Mars Rovers' explorations by fetching and displaying photos captured by these intrepid machines. I developed a real-time connection to International Space Station Data, enabling users to track the ISS's location and access astronaut field data. The project was built using JavaScript for logical operations, HTML, and CSS for structure and styling, Bootstrap for responsive design, and jQuery for simplified DOM manipulations. This application serves as a bridge between space enthusiasts and the far-reaching explorations of humanity beyond Earth.
